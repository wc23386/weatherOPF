This project aims to extract the extraneous factors of the power grid data. Input data is the weather data from weather stations in Texas. The voltage value and line usage/flow from the substations are the prediction targets. The methods include GNN, autoencoder, sparse autoencoder.
It also analyzes the weight and sparsity to pinpoint the significant factors combination.
